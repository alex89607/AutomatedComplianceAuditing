1. Policy Agent

    Function: policy_agent(compliance_document)
    Purpose: Interprets the compliance document to extract key requirements.
    Implementation:
        Constructs a prompt that instructs the AI to act as a compliance expert.
        Asks for key requirements to be listed as bullet points.
        Uses the OpenAI LLM to generate the response.

2. Audit Agent

    Function: audit_agent(compliance_requirements, system_configurations)
    Purpose: Compares the compliance requirements with the actual system configurations to identify non-compliant areas.
    Implementation:
        Constructs a prompt that instructs the AI to act as an audit specialist.
        Provides both the compliance requirements and system configurations.
        Asks for a list of non-compliant items with explanations.

3. Reporting Agent

    Function: reporting_agent(audit_findings)
    Purpose: Generates a comprehensive report with actionable insights based on the audit findings.
    Implementation:
        Constructs a prompt that instructs the AI to act as a reporting analyst.
        Provides guidelines for the report structure.
        Uses the OpenAI LLM to generate the report.

4. Workflow Orchestration

    Function: main()
    Purpose: Orchestrates the execution of all agents in sequence.
    Implementation:
        Runs the Policy Agent and prints the compliance requirements.
        Runs the Audit Agent and prints the audit findings.
        Runs the Reporting Agent and prints the final report.

Running Policy Agent...

Compliance Requirements:

- All user passwords must be at least 12 characters long.
- Passwords must include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- User accounts must be locked after 5 failed login attempts.
- Sensitive data at rest must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- Sensitive data in transit must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

================================================================================

Running Audit Agent...

Audit Findings:

1. **Password Length**: User passwords are set to a minimum of 8 characters instead of the required 12 characters.

2. **Password Complexity**: Current policy requires letters and numbers but does not enforce the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.

3. **Account Lockout Threshold**: Accounts are locked after 10 failed login attempts, exceeding the maximum of 5 allowed.

4. **Data in Transit Encryption**: Data in transit is transmitted without encryption, violating the requirement for industry-standard encryption algorithms.

**Audit Report Summary**

The audit has identified several critical areas where the system configurations do not comply with the established compliance requirements.

---

**Detailed Findings**

1. **Password Length and Complexity**

   - *Non-Compliance*: Passwords are set to a minimum of 8 characters; however, the requirement is at least 12 characters.
   - *Missing Elements*: Passwords do not enforce the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.
   - *Recommendation*: Update the password policy to require a minimum length of 12 characters and include all specified character types.

2. **Account Lockout Policy**

   - *Non-Compliance*: User accounts are locked after 10 failed login attempts instead of the required 5.
   - *Recommendation*: Modify the account lockout settings to trigger after 5 failed login attempts to enhance security.

3. **Data in Transit Encryption**

   - *Non-Compliance*: Data in transit is not encrypted.
   - *Recommendation*: Implement industry-standard encryption protocols such as TLS/SSL to secure data in transit.

---

**Recommended Actions**

- **Immediate**: Update system configurations to comply with password length, complexity, and account lockout policies.
- **Short-Term**: Implement encryption for data in transit to protect sensitive information.
- **Long-Term**: Establish regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to all security requirements.

---

**Conclusion**

Addressing these non-compliance issues promptly is essential to protect sensitive data and align with industry regulations. Failure to comply may result in security breaches and legal repercussions.
